> With String-O-Matic, magic strings are over.
>
>
> Unity's policy for implementing **magic strings** in almost all of its systems **is one the major sources of bugs** **and headaches**, especially for amateurs. **Using constant values** instead of relying on magic strings heavily **reduces** the amount of **runtime errors.**  
>   
> **String-O-Matic** scans your project based on your needs to automatically **generate constants and static classes** holding references to all of those magic strings, effectively **replacing** soft **runtime errors by** robust **compile errors.**  
>   
> 
> Convert **error-prone** code  
> ![SOM Not Used.png](https://forum.unity.com/attachments/som-not-used-png.167799/)  
> into **safe, robust** code

> **Key Features:**  
> 
> *   Replace Unity magic strings for static classes and constants.
> *   Changing magic strings in the Editor will produce compile errors that would otherwise cause undesired beahviour.
> *   Comes with many built-in modules, each one addressing a different system.  
>     
> *   Easily configurable based on each project needs.
> *   Easy to use: you just have to click a button.  
>     
> *   Easy to extend: you can create your own modules, satisfying your own project needs.
> *   Fully documented =)
> *   And last but not least, full **source code included**.

> **Modules:**
