With String-O-Matic, magic strings are over. Generate all your constants at the click of a button.

<details>
<summary><b>Description</b></summary>
<br/>
 Unity's policy for implementing **magic strings** in almost all of its systems **is one the major sources of bugs** **and headaches**, especially for amateurs. **Using constant values** instead of relying on magic strings heavily **reduces** the amount of **runtime errors.**

<br/>

 **String-O-Matic** scans your project based on your needs to automatically **generate constants and static classes** holding references to all of those magic strings, effectively **replacing** soft **runtime errors by** robust **compile errors.**

<summary><b>Key Features</b></summary>
<br/> 
 
 *   Replace Unity magic strings for static classes and constants.
 *   Changing magic strings in the Editor will produce compile errors that would otherwise cause undesired beahviour.
 *   Comes with many built-in modules, each one addressing a different system.  
     
 *   Easily configurable based on each project needs.
 *   Easy to use: you just have to click a button.  
     
 *   Easy to extend: you can create your own modules, satisfying your own project needs.
 *   Fully documented =)
 *   And last but not least, full **source code included**.
