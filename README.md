 With String-O-Matic, magic strings are over.


 Unity's policy for implementing **magic strings** in almost all of its systems **is one the major sources of bugs** **and headaches**, especially for amateurs. **Using constant values** instead of relying on magic strings heavily **reduces** the amount of **runtime errors.**  
   
 **String-O-Matic** scans your project based on your needs to automatically **generate constants and static classes** holding references to all of those magic strings, effectively **replacing** soft **runtime errors by** robust **compile errors.**  
   
 
 Convert **error-prone** code

 into **safe, robust** code
